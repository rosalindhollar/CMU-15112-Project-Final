This project is a Python-based interactive drink ordering simulation built using the cmu_graphics framework. 
The application simulates a front-desk ordering system where each customer places a unique drink order, with pricing, animations, and profit tracking handled programmatically. 
The project emphasizes object-oriented programming (OOP), event-driven design, and user interface logic.
